        <p class="parallaxSection__copy parallaxSection__copy--alt">With certain office supplies becoming less essential, companies must be creative with both their products and campaigns. Australian chain Officeworks uses six social media accounts to engage their audience, amassing a <a class="parallaxSection__link" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/officeworks/?hl=en">49,000-strong</a> Instagram following in the process. Typically, they use these channels to showcase their personal and office stationery products as items that fit seamlessly into the life of any fashionable consumer, on the platforms favored by millennials and Gen Z. We recently looked into ways of reaching the growing population of Chinese millennials who, according to studies, are the most active users on social platforms in the world.</p>
        <p class="parallaxSection__copy parallaxSection__copy--alt">By comparison, Office Depot add a touch of comedy to the supplies market by relaunching their famous app-based <a class="parallaxSection__link" target="_blank" href="https://www.elfyourself.com/">&apos;Elf Yourself&apos;</a> campaign every Christmas. Such marketing moves add brand character to a sector that could sometimes be seen as dry and boring.</p>

            <div class="parallaxSection__copy">Like most industries, the office supplies sector is migrating online, with <a class="parallaxSection__link parallaxSection__link--alt" target="_blank" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-uk-stationery-market-2016-2021-300351119.html">9.7%</a> of stationery purchases coming from <a class="parallaxSection__link parallaxSection__link--alt" target="_blank" href="https://discover.dhl.com/e-commerce">e-commerce</a>. A multichannel approach is essential, as online-only businesses have stolen a march on traditional bricks and mortar retailers. Amazon Business, as a subdivision of the global web giant, services <a class="parallaxSection__link parallaxSection__link--alt" target="_blank" href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/business-consumer/amazon-business-cheap-office-supplies-13387697">more than half of the FTSE 100</a> for their office supplies, allowing users to browse over 250 million competitively priced items. It has had the same devastating effect on its traditional competition as the main brand had on local bookstores, growing from a US$1bn business to <a class="parallaxSection__link parallaxSection__link--alt" target="_blank" href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/09/13/this-is-amazons-fastest-growing-business-ever.aspx">US$10bn in two years</a>.</div>
