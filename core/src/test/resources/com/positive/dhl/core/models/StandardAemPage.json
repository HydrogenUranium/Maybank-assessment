It&#39;s gym subscriptions that are the biggest culprit, but there are plenty more services cashing in on those who are unwilling to cancel. In fact, in the States, US$348 is wasted every year by those who have unused entertainment subscriptions<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>Jennifer Savary, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Arizona\u2019s Eller College of Management and co-author of \u2018The Uncertain Self: How Self-Concept Structure Affects Subscription Choice\u2019<sup>3</sup>, has written extensively on the subject, in an attempt to understand the psychology behind subscriptions.</p>\n<p><i>&quot;We know that people don&#39;t like to waste money but, for some reason, unused subscriptions are catching us out. I am particularly interested in why people want to be seen in a certain way, so I approached this research through that lens.&quot;</i></p>\n<p>Of course, the ease with which people can sign up \u2013&nbsp;with free trials a no-brainer for both buyer and seller \u2013 means that the rise in subscriptions is showing no signs of stopping. But why are so many people signing up for so many services?</p>\n<p><i>&quot;When you separate payment from consumption, it doesn&#39;t hurt so badly because there\u2019s not a specific moment of monetary transaction \u2013 that\u2019s a benefit.

Having a subscription to a product or service helps reflect who a person believes themselves to be \u2013&nbsp;whether that\u2019s a vegetable box, headphones, or something more obscure \u2013&nbsp;and that\u2019s what makes subscriptions services appealing. Some people who subscribe to The Economist may never read it, but wouldn\u2019t dream of cancelling, as it strips away part of their identity.</p>\n<p>Self-identity is ever-changing, and can be impacted by significant life events. Not just things like moving house or getting married but wider events such as the current Brexit-related uncertainty in the UK, for example. At these times, people\u2019s sense of self can be brought into question \u2013&nbsp;and these moments present an opportunity for brands, encouraging potential customers to align to the right type of subscription to help people feel more in control. Take&nbsp;Kindur\u2019s SmartDraw&nbsp;service as an example<sup>4</sup>. The retirement planning company is leaning into the&nbsp;subscription business model&nbsp;to help older people manage their retirement funds. Allowing customers to create a monthly retirement paycheck, its aim is to make managing finances in retirement as simple as when one was working.</p>\n",

According to Whistl<sup>6</sup>,&nbsp;60% of Britons&nbsp;say that they sign up for subscription services to save money \u2013 while 45% do so for the convenience and 30% for the added perks or benefits, such as with Amazon Prime.</p>\n<p>&quot;32% of Americans&nbsp;intend to sign up to a subscription box in the next six months&quot;<sup>7</sup><br>\n</p>\n<p>Of those who subscribe, 22% value personalized experiences, according to McKinsey. Epsilon<sup>8</sup>, meanwhile, has found that 80% of people are more likely to make a purchase if a brand offers a personalized experience, and Deloitte<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;discovered that 20% are willing to pay a premium for a personalized product.

Subscribers pay a monthly fee of between&nbsp;US$9 and US$15, with an up-front fee of up to US$100.&nbsp;After two years, subscribers receive a new pair of headphones, and can keep the old ones, too. Delivered as an impeccably-packaged product, users also receive exclusive content from artists associated with Nura, access to competitions for concert tickets, free music downloads, and exclusive merchandise. Having piloted the idea in Australia, where it sold out in less than a week, Nura has now expanded to the US and UK. Although it should be noted that when the subscription is stopped, all the products have to be returned\u2026</p>\n",

And now, whether it\u2019s razors, makeup, or even furniture, the rise in regularly-received goods and services \u2013 thanks to a small (or large) monthly fee \u2013&nbsp;have seen all sorts arriving on doorsteps at scheduled intervals.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://discover.dhl.com/business/entrepreneurship/subscription-marketing\">Subscription models</a>&nbsp;are, of course, something we\u2019ve covered before on Discover, but a lot can change in a year.<br>\n</p>\n<p>New research<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;on the phenomenon has revealed that in the UK, an estimated �25bn is spent each year on unused subscriptions \u2013&nbsp;an average of �39 per person per month. It&#39;s gym subscriptions that are the biggest culprit, but there are plenty more services cashing in on those who are unwilling to cancel. In fact, in the States, US$348 is wasted every year by those who have unused entertainment subscriptions<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>Jennifer Savary, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Arizona\u2019s Eller College of Management and co-author of \u2018The Uncertain Self: How Self-Concept Structure Affects Subscription Choice\u2019<sup>3</sup>, has written extensively on the subject, in an attempt to understand the psychology behind subscriptions.</p>\n<p><i>&quot;We know that people don&#39;t like to waste money but, for some reason, unused subscriptions are catching us out. I am particularly interested in why people want to be seen in a certain way, so I approached this research through that lens.&quot;</i></p>\n<p>Of course, the ease with which people can sign up \u2013&nbsp;with free trials a no-brainer for both buyer and seller \u2013 means that the rise in subscriptions is showing no signs of stopping. But why are so many people signing up for so many services?</p>\n<p><i>&quot;When you separate payment from consumption, it doesn&#39;t hurt so badly because there\u2019s not a specific moment of monetary transaction \u2013 that\u2019s a benefit. There&#39;s also research looking at what we might call a \u2018cognitive miser\u2019.

Having a subscription to a product or service helps reflect who a person believes themselves to be \u2013&nbsp;whether that\u2019s a vegetable box, headphones, or something more obscure \u2013&nbsp;and that\u2019s what makes subscriptions services appealing. Some people who subscribe to The Economist may never read it, but wouldn\u2019t dream of cancelling, as it strips away part of their identity.</p>\n<p>Self-identity is ever-changing, and can be impacted by significant life events. Not just things like moving house or getting married but wider events such as the current Brexit-related uncertainty in the UK, for example. At these times, people\u2019s sense of self can be brought into question \u2013&nbsp;and these moments present an opportunity for brands, encouraging potential customers to align to the right type of subscription to help people feel more in control. Take&nbsp;Kindur\u2019s SmartDraw&nbsp;service as an example<sup>4</sup>. The retirement planning company is leaning into the&nbsp;subscription business model&nbsp;to help older people manage their retirement funds. Allowing customers to create a monthly retirement paycheck, its aim is to make managing finances in retirement as simple as when one was working.</p>\n",

According to Whistl<sup>6</sup>,&nbsp;60% of Britons&nbsp;say that they sign up for subscription services to save money \u2013 while 45% do so for the convenience and 30% for the added perks or benefits, such as with Amazon Prime.</p>\n<p>&quot;32% of Americans&nbsp;intend to sign up to a subscription box in the next six months&quot;<sup>7</sup><br>\n</p>\n<p>Of those who subscribe, 22% value personalized experiences, according to McKinsey. Epsilon<sup>8</sup>, meanwhile, has found that 80% of people are more likely to make a purchase if a brand offers a personalized experience, and Deloitte<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;discovered that 20% are willing to pay a premium for a personalized product. Which leads us on to Nura, a company renowned for offering premium headphones that automatically adapt to each user&#39;s hearing profile.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Through NuraNow, it\u2019s offering the same quality on a subscription basis, removing the initial price barrier. Subscribers pay a monthly fee of between&nbsp;US$9 and US$15, with an up-front fee of up to US$100.&nbsp;After two years, subscribers receive a new pair of headphones, and can keep the old ones, too. Delivered as an impeccably-packaged product, users also receive exclusive content from artists associated with Nura, access to competitions for concert tickets, free music downloads, and exclusive merchandise. Having piloted the idea in Australia, where it sold out in less than a week, Nura has now expanded to the US and UK. Although it should be noted that when the subscription is stopped, all the products have to be returned\u2026</p>\n",

And even if your products are smaller,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://discover.dhl.com/business/entrepreneurship/startup-logistics\">logistics at scale can be a challenge</a>, so it\u2019s important to choose a partner who can accommodate your offering. Subscription services do offer a more enhanced ability to predict stock requirements \u2013&nbsp;which can be hugely beneficial. Regardless of all these, it\u2019s also crucial to partner with a logistics company who know cross-border trade when you\u2019re looking to grow globally.</p>\n<p>DHL Express operates in over 220 countries and territories, and therefore offers your business huge potential global expansion \u2013 promising door-to-door delivery and the ability for customers to track their shipment, wherever it may be. DHL Express can also provide paperless clearance for getting your goods through customs faster, preventing any potential delays which may impact a subscriber\u2019s experience and their likelihood to stay on.</p>\n<p>Coupled with the ability to offer time-definite delivery, opening&nbsp;<a href=\"https://discover.dhl.com/ship-now\">an account</a>&nbsp;with DHL and subscribing to their services means that, contrary to what you\u2019re giving consumers, there\u2019ll be no surprises \u2013 just reliable, efficient shipping you\u2019ll certainly want to stick with long term.</p>\n",
